#  Hello! Let's give this a try!
I am working my way into programming.  

## My projects and first impressions about programming laguages:  

<div align="center"> My latest project - Users App https://github.com/Massinja/users_app in Ruby. </div>

### Bash   
Almighty!

### C
C is fun! Segfault is even more fun! :D  
The largest project I built in C was [mastermind](https://github.com/Massinja/mastermind).  
There are also my simplistic implementations of [printf](https://github.com/Massinja/printf) function and [cat](https://github.com/Massinja/my_cat) command.  
You can build the [christmas_tree](https://github.com/Massinja/christmas_tree) or [C__my_yacky_solutions](https://github.com/Massinja/c_practice_exercises)  to the exercises I practised on at the beginning.

❤️ C forces me to always check my inputs, think about types and memory management.
It makes me think about performance and optimization, gives me more control and precision over my operations than higher level languages do. Taking a look under the hood is fun.

### Python    
My first "Hello World" was in Python. And now the World is overtaken by Python, sadly. :D  
Indentation should not be an error, and it needs some respect for types, amongst other things.  
Check my very first programming project [bookstore](https://github.com/Massinja/bookstore) and my first [backend](https://github.com/Massinja/first_backend_flask) backend in flask.

### Ruby
There are many ways of doing many things! And while a lot of things might seem interchangeable, they are not, there are subtle differences. 
Not only is Ruby beginner-friendly, but it is also bug friendly, I think...  
Check my Ruby project [Users_app](https://github.com/Massinja/users_app)

  <p align="center">One language should not have four different loops!<p>

### Go
Seems very promising to me. Future back end projects are coming!

### Javascript  
"Javascript is like vegetables, you have to eat them" - Gaetan Juvin  
Check [bouncing_box](https://github.com/Massinja/bouncing_box)  
Typescript is a lesser evil that I am willing to try. Projects are on their way!
